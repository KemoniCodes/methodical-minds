A full-stack web application, modeled from Harvard's CS50 course "Web Programming with Python and JavaScript". 

A full-stack web application that allows logged in and verified users to search for books also to view, add, and store reviews. (HTML,CSS, JS, PYTHON, FLASK, PostgreSql)

Essentially I followed the syllabus' guidelines as to what the application should consist of:
  - Authentication
    - ablity to log in, register, and log out
  - Import a '.csv' file into your database (PostgreSQL), via an 'import.py' file.
  - Search filter that allows the user to search using either the isbn number, author, or title of the book.
    - returns data based on the query made
  - Add Reviews
    - With the psql databse users are able to ad reviews which are then stored in the database, also available to view on book        page.
  - View GoodReads ratings and number of reviews per book using the GoodReads API
  
  Here is a prievew of the application, as well as a link listed above to demo!
