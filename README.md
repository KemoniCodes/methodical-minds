# methodical-minds

A full-stack web application, modeled from Harvard's CS50 course "Web Programming with Python and JavaScript". 

Essentially I followed the syllabus' guidelines as to what the application should consist of:
  - Authentication
    - ablity to log in, register, and log out
  - Import a '.csv' file into your database (PostgreSQL), via an 'import.py' file.
  - Search filter that allows user to search using either the isbn number, author, or title of the book.
    - returns data based on the query made
